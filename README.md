# OpenCV Mini Project - Color Detection

This project demonstrates real-time color detection using OpenCV and HSV. It captures webcam frames, creates a mask for a selected color, removes noise, detects contours, and draws bounding boxes with labels around detected regions. Any color can be detected by simply changing the HSV range values.

## Tech Used

- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
